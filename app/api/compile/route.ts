/**
 * Turns one of your saved resumes into a PDF.
 *
 * This endpoint used to accept a LaTeX string and compile whatever it was
 * given, from anyone, with no sign-in. That is remote code execution wearing a
 * hat: TeX can read files (`\input{/etc/passwd}` renders them into the returned
 * PDF) and loop forever, so the returned document was an exfiltration channel
 * and the timeout was a denial-of-service budget.
 *
 * The fix is not to filter the LaTeX — you cannot reliably filter a Turing
 * complete macro language. It is to stop accepting it. Callers name a resume
 * they own; the server loads it and renders the LaTeX itself. User text now
 * reaches TeX only as escaped arguments, through exactly one function.
