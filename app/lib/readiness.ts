 * would reach a recruiter as visibly broken or missing — an entry with no
 * bullets prints a heading over blank space, an entry with no dates cannot be
 * placed in a career. Those should not be downloadable, because the person
 * cannot see the problem from inside the form and will find out after sending.
 *
 * A **warning** is something weaker than it could be. Those never block. A tool
 * that refuses to give you your own resume until it approves of it is worse
 * than one that hands it over and tells you what it would fix — people have
 * deadlines, and a thin resume sent today beats a perfect one sent never.
