/**
 * Which resume a request is about, and what its file should be called.
 *
 * Shared by the download and the preview so they cannot drift. They are the
 * same document — one is offered to save, the other is shown on screen — and
 * the fastest way to reintroduce the bug this preview work exists to kill would
 * be two places deciding separately what to render.
 *
 * Every read is scoped by userId, so naming an id belonging to somebody else
 * finds nothing rather than returning their resume.
 *
 * The `version` argument is what keeps that promise once old versions can be
 * viewed. Before it existed both callers were pinned to the latest, so they
 * agreed by accident; a preview that could show version 2 while the download
 * still handed over version 5 would be exactly the drift this file was written
 * to prevent, and silent — the filename gives no hint. So it is threaded
 * through here and both callers pass it, or neither does.
