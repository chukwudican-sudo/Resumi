/**
 * The avatar, and what is under it.
 *
 * Your profile lives here because that is where account things are on every
 * other site. It is not a fifth nav item — it is not a fifth destination, it
 * is where you go to look at yourself.
 *
 * Before this, nothing in the app linked to /profile at all. The single
 * navigation to it was the interview redirecting there on completion, and the
 * interview could only be started from the profile page — so the page you
 * delete your data from sat behind a door that opened only from the inside.
 * The privacy policy and the terms both point people at that button, which
 * made them wrong about the product, not just inconvenient.
 *
 * A client component on purpose. UserButton.MenuItems identifies its children
 * by component type at render, and rather than establish whether that survives
 * the server/client boundary, this puts the whole thing on the side of the
 * boundary where Clerk's API is unambiguously supported.
 *
 * Held back until the browser has it, which is the price of those menu items.
 * Clerk renders them through a portal that exists only on the client, so the
 * server sent one shape and the first client render produced another, and React
 * called it a hydration mismatch on every page with a nav — an overlay in
 * development, a silent re-render in production. Both sides now agree on the
 * placeholder and the real thing arrives a tick later, which is invisible next
 * to the avatar image loading anyway.
